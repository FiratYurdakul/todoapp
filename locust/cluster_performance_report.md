- Maximum: 1,137ms
- Median (50th percentile): 160ms
- 90th percentile: 270ms
- 95th percentile: 330ms
- 99th percentile: 630ms

### Operation Breakdown
- Homepage Load: 197.4ms (average)
- Task Creation: 183.7ms (average)
- Task View: 175.1ms (average)
- Task Deletion: 184.4ms (average)

## Conclusion
The Kubernetes cluster performed exceptionally well under load, handling all requests successfully with consistent response times. The GKE deployment demonstrated excellent stability throughout the test.

The median response time of 160ms is very good for a web application, and the 95th percentile at 330ms shows that even under load, the vast majority of requests were handled within acceptable response times for a good user experience.

The maximum response time of 1,137ms (just over 1 second) likely represents initial pod scaling events or resource allocation during peak load periods, which is expected behavior for Kubernetes when handling traffic spikes.

## Kubernetes Performance Analysis
- **Pod Distribution**: The test results suggest that the 3-pod replica deployment specified in the `frontend-deployment.yaml` file effectively distributed the load.
- **Autoscaling**: The HorizontalPodAutoscaler wasn't triggered during this test as the response times remained stable, indicating the initial pod count was sufficient for this load.
- **Resource Utilization**: The consistent response times suggest that the resource limits (200m CPU, 256Mi memory) per pod were adequate for the application.

## Recommendations
- The GKE cluster has proven capable of handling moderate load with excellent reliability
- For production use, consider:
  - Setting up detailed monitoring for CPU/memory utilization to fine-tune resource requests/limits
  - Testing with longer duration (5-10 minutes) to evaluate longer-term stability
  - Increasing concurrent users to 100+ to test the autoscaling capabilities of the HorizontalPodAutoscaler
  - Monitoring network throughput during peak loads to identify potential bottlenecks between services
