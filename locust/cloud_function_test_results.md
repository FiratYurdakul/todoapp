# Cloud Function Performance Test Results

## Test Configuration
- Date: May 21, 2025
- Host: https://us-central1-todo-cloud-app-20250521.cloudfunctions.net
- Test Duration: 30 seconds
- Concurrent Users: 30
- Spawn Rate: 5 users/second

## Performance Results

### Request Statistics
- Total Requests: 1,075
- Successful Requests: 1,075 (100%)
- Failed Requests: 0 (0%)
- Average Request Rate: 35.97 requests/second

### Response Time
- Average: 220ms
- Minimum: 177ms
- Maximum: 1,910ms
- Median (50th percentile): 200ms
- 90th percentile: 230ms
- 95th percentile: 300ms
- 99th percentile: 690ms

### Functional Validation
- The Cloud Function successfully validated and capitalized all task titles
- All tasks were properly formatted regardless of input capitalization
- No functional errors were detected

## Conclusion
The Cloud Function performed very well under load, handling all requests successfully with consistent response times. The function showed excellent stability and maintained its functional behavior (capitalizing task titles) throughout the test.

The 99th percentile response time (690ms) is well within acceptable limits for a serverless function. The maximum response time of 1,910ms likely represents cold starts, which is expected behavior for serverless functions that scale on demand.

## Recommendations
- The Cloud Function has proven capable of handling a moderate load with excellent reliability
- For production use, consider:
  - Setting up additional monitoring for cold start latencies
  - Implementing a keep-warm strategy if consistent low-latency is critical
  - Adding additional load tests with even higher concurrency if expecting very high traffic
